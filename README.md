# ECG_Analysis_deepLearning

This project aims to develop a deep learning-based system for analyzing electrocardiogram (ECG) signals. The system will utilize advanced neural network architectures to accurately detect and classify various heart waves. By analyzing ECG data, the system can provide valuable insights for early diagnosis and prevention of heart-related diseases
